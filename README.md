This is a basic recipe website created by kvkari.

In this project, I hope to practice and build the HTML knowledge I've acquired so far in the Odin Project.

The skills I will have demonstrated once the project is completed are: Git, GitHub, HTML elements and tags, paragraphs, headings, lists, links, images, and commit messages.
